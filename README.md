# Yelp-Recommendation-System
This repository contains the implementation of a Yelp recommendation system using a UV decomposition technique. The recommendation system is designed to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and past interactions with businesses on the Yelp platform.

The recommendation system is implemented from scratch, using the principles described in the book "Mining of Massive Datasets" by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeffrey D. Ullman. The UV decomposition method is employed to find the optimal decomposition of a utility matrix, which represents user-business interactions.

The implementation in this repository is for educational purposes and serves as a learning tool for understanding collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in recommendation systems.
